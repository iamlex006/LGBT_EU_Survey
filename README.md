# LGBT_EU_Survey
An analysis of the results of the 2012 LGBT survey conducted in the EU by the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency. 

In this analysis I focused on the perception of respondents about language, discrimination, violence against LGBT people. The analysis was done at the EU level as well as country level for more detailed views. 

Content:
- The data cleaning and analysis was done in 2 parts, they can be found in LexQESpart1.ipnyb and LexQESpart2.ipnyb: 
    - Part 1 includes the data download, cleaning and saving the final data. 
    - Part 2 includes the High level and detailed Exploratory Data Analysis, as well as a hypothesis test on the respondent population. 

- Visualisation of the results was done in tablean and can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/views/QESdetailed/b1_ab?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

- The final presentation of the results is in QES Survey 20220210.pptx

Note: The expected output for this project was a 5 minute presentation, not giving time to go into much detail, but a further analysis of the results would be very interesting and bring more insights. 

With thanks to the EU Fundamental Rights Agency for conducting the survey and making the data available for analysis.
